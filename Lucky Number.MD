Given a sorted array of n integers, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the array equal to its value.

Return a lucky integer in the array. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

If you have multiple lucky integers, please return the first lucky integer in the array (lucky number with the least index).

Input
First line contains a positive integer n, denoting the number of elements in the array. It is followed by n lines. Each line contains one integer denoting an element in the array.

Output
One line specifying the lucky integer in the array

Example
Input:

4
2
2
3
4
Output:

2
Explanation
First line is 4, i.e. 4 elements in the array. The array is [2,2,3,4]. We can see that number 2 is repeating 2 times hence it is the lucky number which is our output
